# Metal Casting product image classification for quality inspection
## What is Casting?
Casting is a manufacturing process in which a liquid material is usually poured into a mold, which contains a hollow cavity of the desired shape, and then allowed to solidify.

## Types of casting defects:
There are many types of defect in casting like blow hole, pin hole, burr,shrinkage defects, mold material defects, pouring metal defects, metallurgical defects, etc.

## Objective of this project:
The objective of this project is to automate the process of finding defects in the casting process. A casting defect is an undesired irregularity in a metal casting process. For removing this defective product all industries have their quality inspection department. But the main problem is that this inspection process is carried out manually. It is a very time consuming process and due to human error the proces of rejecting defects is not 100% accurate.This can be the cause of rejection of an entire order which would lead to huge losses. Our model will try to eliminate this loss of revenue and make the QC process as accurate as possible.

## Dataset used for this project:
[Casting products image dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ravirajsinh45/real-life-industrial-dataset-of-casting-product)

## Type of data:
The problem is an image classification problem. We have a train dataset having 6633 images and test dataset of 715 images

## Conclusions
This project helped me understand how useful deep learning and image classification can be in real industries. Inspection and quality control is an aspect I have observed in all my past internships. Whether it be with robotic systems or welding processes. An advantage of ML and DL models is that it can be implemented on other image sets with minimal changes. This makes it much more advantageous and is now the new way of programming.
For future work, this project could be a game changer for quality control in heavy machinary industries. However adopting this in the industry could take sometime due to infrastructure requirements like cameras and a set process which would automate the Quality Control process.
